# amicable_numbers
Amicable numbers are two different natural numbers related in such a way that the sum of the proper divisors of each is equal to the other number.
It could also be called FRIENDLY numbers.
the first set of such numbers is (220 and 284), due to the reason stated above.

I optimized the actoring algorithm to save time - hence minnimum recursion and callback functions.
Feel free to commit and make changes.
